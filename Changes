Revision history for Perl module Lingua::EN::Fractions

0.03 2014-06-07
    - Skip Number::Fraction as a prereq, since it's only explicitly
      used in a testsuite, which is skipped if you don't have
      Number::Fraction installed.

0.02 2014-06-06
    - Fix typo in example output in pod. Thanks to Nick Patch.
    - Added a testsuite to confirm that fraction2words() works fine
      with instances of Number::Fraction.

0.01 2014-06-05
    - First release to CPAN, inspired by email from Sean Burke
